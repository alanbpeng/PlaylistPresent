# PlaylistPresent

This is a Rails application that publicly display an user's Spotify library or playlist of their choosing.

It was made back when Rails 4.2 was the latest version, so it needs some modernizing work before it will be in a hostable shape. (Also I'll need to find another host since it was originally hosted on Heroku's no longer existent free tier.)
